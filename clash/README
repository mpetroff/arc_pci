Aides for assembling DSP56300 code under Linux.

 scripts: wrappers for wine + CLAS

 srec: simple library for handling srec files and a lod2s converter.

To make these available to everyone on the system, run
  make
  sudo make install

In order to run the assembler, you will need 1) the assembler and 2)
WINE.  Those can be obtained by:

  wget http://e-mode.phas.ubc.ca/~mhasse/mhasse/arc_pci/clas563.zip
  sudo apt-get install wine

Once wine is installed, unzip that code to your "C: drive";
  cd ~/.wine/drive_c/
  unzip ~/clas563.zip

or whatever.  The scripts look for the assembler in that folder.
Sorry.
